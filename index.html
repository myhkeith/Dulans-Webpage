        <h2>Fried Chicken - Mac and Cheese - Yams</h2>
        <p> A tried and true classic combination in the world of soul food. Juicy fried chicken matched one of the most well-known power couples, Mac and Cheese and Yams. A food hack, known by many, is to eat both the sweet Yams and Mac and Cheese in the same bite, but beware... you might come running back in line for more! </p>

        <h2>Baked Fish - Beans - Mixed Vegetables</h2>
        <p> A wholesome and nutritious meal with a mouthwatering baked fish, seasoned to perfection and cooked until it's flaky and tender. Complementing the fish is a side of protein-rich beans and a colorful medley of mixed vegetables. This balanced and delicious combination offers a delightful dining experience while keeping your health and well-being in mind. (My personal favorite) </p>
